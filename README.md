# Password Manager

## Overview
This is a program that allows the user to add, store and manage passwords. The fun fact about this repository is that it encrypts the passwords when storing them.

## Experience
Seeing as software development is where my strength lies rather than web development, I found this really easy. The challenging part was installing an extension that was going to help me to encrypt and decrypt the passwords. Other than that, it was pretty easy to implement since I know most of the concepts from previous languages like C and C++. 
It was a fun project.
